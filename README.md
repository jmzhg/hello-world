# hello-world

Hi earthlings! James here, my colleagues call me Jamesus.. Just trying to dive into the languages of the internet. I grew up in three different continents and have learned Spanish, English, and Mandarin -- while having a passion with gaming and computers. It's time I put my knowledge into how things are built in something I use every single day and I'm very excited to start, here at github!
